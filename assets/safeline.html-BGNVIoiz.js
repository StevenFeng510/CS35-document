Safeline Introduction</span></a></h3><p>Safeline is an open-source, web security solution developed to provide enhanced security for web applications and services. It operates as a Web Application Firewall (WAF), helping to protect applications from common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks.By analyzing incoming and outgoing traffic, Safeline can detect and block malicious activity in real-time, preventing potential vulnerabilities from being exploited.</p><img src="'+o+'" style="zoom:20%;"><h3 id="_2-configure-application-gateway-for-app-service" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-configure-application-gateway-for-app-service"><span>2. <strong>Configure Application Gateway for App Service</strong></span></a></h3><p>Before setting up Safeline, it&#39;s necessary to first configure an <strong>Application Gateway</strong> for the Azure App Service. This is required because the App Service uses a virtual IP address, which Safeline cannot directly use for traffic forwarding. The Application Gateway provides a public IP address that serves as a stable endpoint for external access. Safeline can then route traffic through this public IP, allowing it to securely act as a reverse proxy for the App Service.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Navigate to the Azure Portal</strong> and select <strong>Create a resource</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Choose <strong>Networking</strong> &gt; <strong>Application Gateway</strong> and configure the gateway settings.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p></li><li><p>Under the <strong>Frontend IP configuration</strong>, assign a <strong>Public IP</strong> address for the gateway. This IP will be used as the endpoint that Safeline will route traffic through.</p><p>In the <strong>Backend pool</strong> settings, add your App Service as the backend target. Select <strong>Add a backend pool</strong> and specify your App Service using its FQDN or IP-based settings.</p></li><li><p>Once deployed, this Application Gateway will serve as a secure entry point for traffic heading to the App Service. Safeline will use the public IP address provided by the gateway to securely forward requests, ensuring that traffic is correctly routed to the App Service.</p></li></ul><h3 id="_3-install-safeline-on-a-virtual-machine" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-install-safeline-on-a-virtual-machine"><span>3. <strong>Install Safeline on a Virtual Machine</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Provision a Virtual Machine</strong> on Azure or another cloud provider to host Safeline.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p></li><li><p><strong>SSH into the VM</strong> after setup, then download and install Safeline by following the [Safeline installation guide on their official website](<a href="https://github.com/chaitin/SafeLine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub - chaitin/SafeLine: serve as a reverse proxy to protect your web services from attacks and exploits.</a>).</p></li><li><p>Once installed, configure the firewall and network settings according to Safeline’s instructions to ensure secure communication between your Application Gateway and Safeline.</p></li></ul><h3 id="_4-configure-safeline-for-traffic-forwarding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-configure-safeline-for-traffic-forwarding"><span>4. <strong>Configure Safeline for Traffic Forwarding</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><p>Set up Safeline to forward traffic from the Application Gateway to your backend App Service.</p></li><li><p>In the Safeline configuration, specify the IP addresses and forwarding rules to ensure traffic is correctly routed.</p></li><li><p>Apply any necessary security settings within Safeline for monitoring and traffic control.</p></li><li><p>Configure a firewall on the <strong>Application Gateway</strong> and set up access restrictions on the <strong>App Service</strong> to ensure that traffic can only flow in from the Safeline server.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p></li></ul><h3 id="_5-domain-configuration-and-tls-setup" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-domain-configuration-and-tls-setup"><span>5.Domain Configuration and TLS Setup</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Purchase and Set Up a Domain in GoDaddy</strong>: <ul><li>If you haven’t already, purchase a domain from GoDaddy or other websites.
