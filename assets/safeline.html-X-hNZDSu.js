Safeline Introduction</span></a></h3><p>Safeline is an open-source, web security solution developed to provide enhanced security for web applications and services. It operates as a Web Application Firewall (WAF), helping to protect applications from common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks. By analyzing incoming and outgoing traffic, Safeline can <strong>detect and block malicious</strong> activity in real-time, preventing potential vulnerabilities from being exploited.</p><img src="'+s+'" style="zoom:20%;"><h3 id="_2-configure-application-gateway-for-app-service" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-configure-application-gateway-for-app-service"><span>2. <strong>Configure Application Gateway for App Service</strong></span></a></h3><p>Before setting up Safeline, it&#39;s necessary to first configure an <strong>Application Gateway</strong> for the Azure App Service. This is required because the App Service uses a virtual IP address, which Safeline cannot directly use for traffic forwarding. The Application Gateway provides a public IP address that serves as a stable endpoint for external access. Safeline can then route traffic through this public IP, allowing it to securely act as a reverse proxy for the App Service.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Navigate to the Azure Portal</strong> and select <strong>Create a resource</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Choose <strong>Networking</strong> &gt; <strong>Application Gateway</strong> and configure the gateway settings.</p></li></ol><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><ol start="3"><li>Configure the basic information like resource group, region and application gateway name.

This IP address will act as the primary endpoint for all incoming traffic. Safeline will use this public IP to securely forward external requests, ensuring that any traffic directed at this IP address is routed through the gateway.</li></ol><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><ol start="5"><li>In the <strong>Backend pool</strong> settings, link your App Service as the backend target for the Application Gateway. Select <strong>Add a backend pool</strong>, then specify your App Service using its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or by using IP-based settings, depending on your App Service configuration. Once all configurations are complete, deploy the Application Gateway. From this point forward, it will act as a secure and reliable entry point, managing and forwarding traffic heading to your App Service. You need to configure the frontend listener and backend targets.</li></ol><img src="'+p+'" style="zoom:100%;"><img src="'+d+'" style="zoom:80%;"><p>Configure the backend targets by choosing your app service as the backend source.
